# Sentiment Analysis Project
This project implements a streaming sentiment analysis pipeline for Reddit comments using Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and a web-based GUI. It is part of the Big Data module at the Institute for Data Engineering at Technical University of Hamburg.

## Purpose
The goal is to analyze Reddit comments to determine positive or negative sentiment toward specific keywords (e.g., "Trump", "Harris"). The pipeline processes data in real-time, updates the sentiment model, and displays results via a web interface.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/faizan041/sentiment_analysis.git
